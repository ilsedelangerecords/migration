    "title": "The Dutch country top 100, vol 1",
    "artist": "Ilse DeLange",
    "year": "2000",
    "label": ": Dino music Released : 2000 In cooperation with Country FM and the Country Gazette a 4-fold CD has been released in 2001. The CD's represent 100 of the best Country-songs performed by Dutch artists. The songs for the CD's have been selected by Rob Peters and Ruud Hermans. These songs with Ilse DeLange are pre- World of hurt and very hard to get, I wonder if they ever have been released on any other CD A other detail is that this top 100 does not contain a track from World of hurt, I think Warner music did not give permission to use a song. This album did not get in any chart.
