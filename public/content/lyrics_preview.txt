Lyrics
We fall into the ocean
We're breathin' under water
Don't know where we're going
But don't you think we oughta
Find land, find land, dry land
I'm following behind you
Moving in slow motion
Searching for a rescue
Something to put hope in
Find land, find land, dry land
My heart is tired, it can't go on
Fighting waves that are too strong
Been tossed around and beaten by the sea
Of you and me, we've both jumped ship
We're adrift
How do we drain an ocean
Is there a secret at the bottom
A door that we can open
A nozzle or a faucet
To let out, to let out
To get out
Every night I watch the sunset
Does it sink as fast as I do
How does it hold its Previous breath
Through the loneliness of solitude
Through the dark, in the dark, when it's dark
My heart is tired, it can't go on
Fighting waves that are too strong
Been tossed around and beaten by the sea
Of you and me, we've both jumped ship
We're adrift
The tides, oh they lift us up
And then they put us down again
It's never ending
No it is not your fault, we're lost
My heart is tired, it can't go on
Fighting waves that are too strong
Been tossed around and beaten by the sea
Of you and me, we've both jumped ship
We're adrift
Adrift

Lyrics
I can't give
When you give nothing in return
I can't live
When all my freedom's burned
Above me
In front of me, no room for you
Beside me
Is all that I can do
Don't hold me
Don't tie me down
Don't change me
Leave what you found
All alone
So quiet
Your insecurities are clear
You hide it
There's so much that you fear
Run naked
There's beauty in an open soul
Just break it
Your desire to control
Don't hold me
Don't tie me down
Don't change me
Leave what you found
You won't break me
I won't turn around
You can't take me
And leave what you've found
All alone
All alone
Don't throw your ideals at me
All alone
Baby I'm not something that you can own
All alone
I won't live in your world for me
All alone
Look at me I'm better of
All alone
On the run from reality
All alone
All alone
Your attitude is all pride to me
All alone
Keep it up and you're gonna be
All Alone, all Alone
All alone

Lyrics
In the space left behind
Empty notes in my mind
Still na√Øve and still blind
But not forgotten
Undiscovered but true
Older version of you
Let's rewind and go back
Let's pretend we don't have
All the junk in the back
Almost lost each other
Even chances are gone
And we just carry on
And all that I have
Is all I can give
You're inside my soul...now
We've fallen from grace
Echoes of faith
All that I own
Is all I got to give
A reflection of trust
Is crumbled to dust
If we're building we must
Keep it together
Now the damage is done
Nothing's hiding the sun
No more wine in the glass
If we drink it too fast
Bitter taste on my tongue
Slowly fading
All the colors of blue
I'm erasing in you
And all that I have
Is all I can give
You're inside my soul...now
We've fallen from grace
Echoes of faith
All that I own
Is all I got to give
(Is all I got to give)
'Cause all that I have
Is all I can give
You're inside my soul...now
We've fallen from grace
Echoes of faith
All that I own
And all that I have
Is all I can give
You're inside my soul...now
We've fallen from grace
Echoes of faith
All that I own
Is all I got to give
Is all I got to give
Is all I got to give
All i got to give

Wanna love you forever
Any time any place
for worse and for better
with fire and with grace
Hold you within me
An'setting you free
if you let it happen
let it happen to me
I'm holding this picture
I found in my dreams
it's you looking at me
in wonder it seems
each way that i go
you're close as can be
ain't it amazing
how you came to me
You may be wonderin'
if hard I'm to find
just run through the pages
in the back of your mind
D for desire
where wishes came true
just close your eyes now
is all that you do

Lyrics
When I call you in the morning
Tell you everything's allright
I can't see into the future
Don't see the danger in the night
When I hear the sirene wailing
See the flashing of the light
I know that there's trouble
There are battles yet to fight
I may not have all the answers
Wouldn't have it any other way
There's an inner peace I'm seeking
There's a lightness in my soul
And everytime I think I found it
Wanna touch it, feel it, hold it
And the day that I stop asking
Will be the day I say goodbye
The world may not be safer
But there's no truth without a lie
I may not have all the answers, no
Wouldn't have it any other way
I've asked the good Lord Jesus
I'm asking Allah too
I tried the great God Boeddha
And now I'm asking you
I may not have all the answers, no
Wouldn't have it any other way
When you're deep in troubled water
You've got to fight for every breath
You feel you're getting weaker
Facing life, you're facing death
And if you have a God to turn to
Don't turn the other way
Or a friend that you can count on
Just a prayer you can say
I may not have all the answers, no
Wouldn't have it any other way
All the answers

Lyrics
My head‚Äôs full
My soul‚Äôs on fire
Relentless you made me cry
When you tore a hole in my heart
And you broke me down part by part
You crashed into me
You crashed into me
I need you to leave
Just get up and up leave
I almost surrendered
You almost made me believe
Feel like I‚Äôm picking up pieces
Looking in places I can‚Äôt reach
We sat on the sun and you blinded me
Almost
Your footprints
Are everywhere
The scars here
Will they repair
Did you aim for me to break your fall
Nothing I said could make you stop
You crashed into me
You crashed into me
I almost surrendered
You almost made me believe
Feel like I‚Äôm picking up pieces
Looking in places I can‚Äôt reach
We sat on the sun and you blinded me
Almost
You crashed into me
You crashed into me
You crashed into me
You crashed into me
I almost surrendered
You almost made me believe
Feel like I‚Äôm picking up pieces
Looking in places I can‚Äôt reach
When you crashed into me
I almost surrendered
You almost made me believe
Feel like I‚Äôm picking up pieces
Looking in places I can‚Äôt reach
We sat on the sun and you blinded me

Lyrics
Als je iets kan doen
Een oceaan van verdriet
vraagt meer dan een lied
maar toch
ik wil niet zeggen dat ik alle goede doelen steun
en ook niet dat ik arme mensen altijd ondersteun
‚Äòk wil niet beweren dat ik zelf nou zo heilig ben
Ik kan niet zeggen dat ik dagelijk alle kranten lees
en ook niet dat ik alle vrezen van het leven vrees
‚Äòk zal niet beweren dat `k op elke barricade sta
Maar dat betekent niet
dat ik mijn ogen sluit voor onrecht en verdriet
dat de wereld het maar uitzoekt zonder mij
dat ik niet opensta
draag graag mijn steentje bij
nee dat betekent niet
dat ik niet door heb wat je voor ellende ziet
ik weet ook ik kan soms iets doen
en als je iets kan doen
waarom zou je dat dan niet
voor een ander doen?
ik kan niet zeggen dat ik wakker lig van hongersnood
ik zal niet doen alsof ik bezig ben met kwaad en dood
‚Äòk zal niet ontkennen dat ik lekker ga
verdien goed mijn brood
ik zal niet doen alsof ik beter dan een ander ben
dat ik van alles wat ik doe opeens zo zeker ben
ik ben maar doodgewoon een mens die nog leeft
net als jij
maar dat betekent niet
dat ik mijn ogen sluit voor onrecht en verdriet
dat de wereld het maar uitzoekt zonder mij
dat ik niet opensta
draag graag mijn steentje bij
nee dat betekent niet
dat ik niet door heb wat je voor ellende ziet
ik weet ook ik kan soms iets doen
en als je iets kan doen
waarom zou je dat dan niet
voor een ander doen?
de tsunami is de haven vol van beving
is zwaar bedolven, gehavend, door
honderd doden door nabestaanden gevonden
hoeft niet eens het is onbegonnen
alles loopt in het honderdduizend
gesnoerde monden ten onder door het gedonder
het is zonde
je doet niets tegen het geweld
maar ieder mensenleven telt
dus wordt een held
en stort wat geld op giro 555
ook al is het maar een beetje
we doen dit voor de mensheid
en dat weetje!
het gaat om grote bakken geld die nodig zijn
maar als je een beetje geeft is dat ook okee
het gaat om besef
besef van waarde van elk leven
daar help je je medemensen mee
maar dat betekent niet
dat ik mijn ogen sluit voor onrecht en verdriet
dat de wereld het maar uitzoekt zonder mij
dat ik niet opensta
draag graag mijn steentje bij
nee dat betekent niet
dat ik niet door heb wat je voor ellende ziet
ik weet ook ik kan soms iets doen *soms wel*
en als je iets kan doen
waarom zou je dat dan niet *waarom niet*
voor een ander doen?
waarom zou je dat dan niet
voor een ander doen?

Lyrics
Always overcome
Like the sun at my window
In the morning when I wake
I am taken without warning
By the light in your face
Sometimes it scares me darling
This feeling of constant ache
As if you came much closer
My heart would surely break
It never ceases me to amaze me
When it's said and done
After all this time when I am with you
I am always overcome
Used to feel like I was drifting
Always in and out of love
Ever since you've been with me
I can't stand to leave you arms
It never ceases me to amaze me
When it's said and done
After all this time when I am with you
I am always overcome
All this love
All these years
Made my life something real
If I had never found you
Don't think I would believe
Love so strong could surround me
That I could lift me off my knees
It never ceases me to amaze me
When it's said and done
After all this time when I am with you
I am always overcome
All this love
All these years
Made my life something real

Lyrics
Angel eyes
Boy, you're looking mighty fine tonight
And every girl's got you in her sights
What you're doing with a clown like me
Is surely one of life's little mysteries
So tonight I'll ask the stars above
How did I ever win your love?
What did I do, what did I do, what did I say
To turn your angel eyes my way?
And I'm the girl who never learned to dance
I never even got one second glance
Across the crowded room, that was close enough
I could look, but I could never touch
So tonight I'll ask the stars above
How did I ever win your love?
What did I do, what did I do, what did I say
To turn your angel eyes my way?
Don't anybody wake me if this is a dream
'Cause he is the best thing that's ever happened to me
All you girls you can, but you look all you like
But this man you see, he's leaving with me tonight
And there's just one more thing I need to know
If this is love then why does it scare me so
It must be something only you can see
But boy, I feel it when you look at me
So tonight I'll ask the stars above
How did I ever win your love?
What did I do, what did I do, what did I say
To turn your angel eyes my way?
What did I do, what did I do, what did I say
To turn your angel eyes my way?

----------------------------------------
Well my daddy he stood at the foot of the stairs
He was calling to me at the time
And I knew even then
I could die for the thoughts
That I kept in the back of my mind
But I dared not to speak
How I felt for my dad
'Cause there were no words to define
This ball of confusion
Of feelings and stuff
That I kept in the back of my mind
So I took to the highway
And I kept to myself
Just a lookin' and hopin' to find
Some solutions, some answers
Some way to exist
All this stuff in the back of my mind
So I took me a job
And I took me a man
And I took me a bottle of wine
But it did not take long
'Til all I had left
Was this junk in the back of my mind
Drivin' like rain, on a runaway train
Flyin' blind
Shot from the dark
In the back of my mind
Well the end of the tunnel
It never came up
'Til I came to the end of the line
And I saw that the light
I'd been hoping to see
Was a spark in the back of my mind
And the cold wind that blew
Through the hole in my heart
Made a fire for the very first time
Of some branches of trust
And a kindling of faith
And that spark in the back of my mind
Drivin' like rain, on a runaway train
Flyin' blind
Shot from the dark
In the back of my mind
Shot from the dark
In the back of my mind
Back of my mind

Stay tonight
Let me hold you like I never did before
Take my arms
And let me hold you like I never did before
And I should have tried just to talk about this
Waiting, ending
I should have tried just to let you know
That I'm still here
So before you let me go...
Take my hands
Let me touch you like I never did before
Take my heart and let me love you
Like I never did before
And I should have tried just to talk about it
Waiting, ending
I should have tried just to let you know
That I'm still here
But we waste it every time
Now my heart is on the line
And we see ourselves no more
When we're closing every door
It's so much harder than before
So before you let me go
Before you let me go...
Save the dance and let me spin you
'Til your world is turning round and round
Round and round, round and round
Save the chance and let me show you
Just like you need a little more
Just like you need a little more
And I should have tried just to talk about it
Waiting, ending
I should have tried just to let you know
That I'm still here
But we waste it every time
Now my heart is on the line
Until we see ourselves no more
When we're closing every door
It's so much harder than before
So much harder than before
So before you let me go...
Before you let me go...
But we waste it every time
Now my heart is on the line
Until we see ourselves no more
When we're closing every door
It's so much harder than before
So much harder than before
But we waste it every time
Now my heart is on the line
And now we bruise with every step
When we're closing every door
Can we make it easier
Some time?
Some time...

Lyrics
The only thing that keeps me down is gravity
Without it I might fly around
Above life's raging sea
You've released my soul
You've let my spirit go
So I can be the untied melody
A song that rises
From my heart
Through these lips
Back to you
Beyond gravity, lifting me
Up above the clouds
And if ever we fall, we'll come to rest
Above the raging sea
And beyond gravity
I'm a picture
Made of broken things
A fallen feather from an angel's wings
The shattered pieces of my past
Are held together like stained glass
And as your love shines through me
I reach out for the colours of you
So I can be the untied melody
A song that rises
From my heart
Through these lips
Back to you
Beyond gravity, lifting me
Up above the clouds
And if ever we fall, we'll come to rest
Above the raging sea
And beyond gravity
And if ever we fall, we'll come to rest
Above the raging sea
And beyond gravity
Beyond gravity

No petrol in the car
No pennies in the jar
How did we get this far
Baby
No moon in the sky
No roof to keep us dry
Looks like rain tonight
I got a sinking feeling
Coming over me
I got a sinking feeling
I tried to paint a picture
A picture through the clouds for you
Green, your smiling eyes
Red, cause I made you cry
Grey, these rainy skies
Tomorrow will be blue
Stay love
Stay tonight
These rainy skies
Tomorrow will be blue
No caffeine in the coffee
No sugar in my tea
Just watching the TV
With the sound down No radio on
No tune to the song
And the words are wrong
Your fingers tapping
To the rhythm of the rain
Your fingers...
I tried to paint a picture
A picture through the clouds for you
Green, your smiling eyes
Red, cause I made you cry
Grey, these rainy skies
Tomorrow will be blue
Stay love

Starving in desperation, on a slow steady road to hell

Five hundred and nine black sheep slowly jump over me
As soon as I try to get you off my mind I fail
Another dreamless night watching the moon cross the sky
Cursing the sun cause I know it has won again
I breathe in, breathe out
I'm stuck in those shadowed doubts
I'm feeling my way
So tired of seeing blind
But I breathe in, breathe out
There's nothing I can do now
Breathe in, breathe out
I'm raising my white flag high
I surrender myself though I'm not sure why
And I hate being wrong and I never let on when I am
But I'd rather lose my pride than to lose you as mine
And I don't like to beg but I'm down on my knees this time
Breathe in, breathe out
I'm stuck in those shadowed doubts
I'm feeling my way
So tired of seeing blind
But I breathe in, breathe out
There's nothing I can do now
But breathe in, breathe out
Why am I so stubborn for the sake of it
I bet I'd try to catch and tame the wind
And all the while I know that you would take me back
What's wrong with that
I breathe in, breathe out
I breathe in, breathe out
I'm feeling my way
So tired of seeing blind
But I breathe in, breathe out
Yeah I breathe in
Five hundred and nine black sheep slowly jump over me
Breathe in, breathe out

Lyrics
What we have here is a misunderstanding
A lack of communication
What we have here is
Two people talking and nobody listening
Screaming and yelling things hard to take back
There's worse things than dying
When you've lost your reason for living
There's no point in fighting
When reasons for staying are missing
I'm leaving
There's something out there that I'm needing
There's more to life, there's got to be more to life
Than breathin'
There are still echoes of you and me laughing
Bouncing off walls of canyons in my mind
Stirring up memories of love long forgotten
How'd we let go of something like that
There's worse things than dying
When you've lost your reason for living
There's no point in fighting
When reasons for staying are missing
I'm leaving
There's something out there that I need
There's more to life, there's got to be more to life
I'm leaving
There's something out there that I'm needing
There's more to life, there's got to be more to life
Than breathin'
Breathin'

Rewrote the story, that I have told
Can tell what's rubble and what is gold
You put a softness back on my hands
Repaired with mystery my confidence
Before I knew it, you understood
You're on my skin now, run through my blood
It's really gonna make you wonder
'Cause I no longer hide
I have grown, no longer invincible
Cried rivers full
In your waters I am calm
Rain wash me clean
All your strenght reflects in me
I'm never gonna let you go
This broken girl is whole
I feel uncertain, I felt unworthy
Smallest attention, not meant for me
My shoulders carried, you took that load
You took the weight off, from off my soul
It's really gonna make you wonder
'Cause I no longer hide
I have grown, no longer invincible
Cried rivers full
In your waters I am calm
Rain wash me clean
All your strenght reflects in me
I'm never gonna let you go
This broken girl is whole
'Cause every little whisper, now gets told
And all the little secrets that I've known are now yours
You've stopped the bleeding, you made me whole
'Cause I no longer hide
I have grown, no longer invincible
Cried rivers full
In your waters I am calm
Rain wash me clean
All your strenght reflects in me
Rain, rain wash me clean
Wash me clean
Hide, hide
I have grown, no longer invincible
Cried rivers full
In your waters I am calm
Rain wash me clean
All your strength reflects in me

And you're left alone to ask of the ground
"Will you hold?"

This world alone is not enough
The swollen song burns and tapers off
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
Where fearless ones go out and play
Barreling through to Heaven's gates
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
Her skin beneath her fingernails
Blood stains tell her sordid tales
She is beautiful
She is beautiful
'Cause night recedes in scorching lines
The city's burning all the time
She is beautiful

But will you hold her?
Will you hold her?

The power is in your hands
The dust will fall to sand
Got to make this land your own
You must feel free to fall
Know trust will catch us all
And faith calls out your name
When I let go of hope
There's no one left to follow
There's nothing but the power to believe in me
I reach for what I know
When I can't see tomorrow
I carry hope
There is no security
In all it is we see
Tomorrow is your home
When I let go of hope
And there's no one left to follow
There's nothing but the power to believe in me
I reach for what I know
When I can't see tomorrow
I carry hope
The wind carries the past
It whispers loud and fast
From days now gone
They never Previous
I feel inside of me
It's lifting me out of sorrow
This energy's filling me up
My head held high
Lift me up. Lift me up
Lift me up. Lift me up
When I let go of hope
And there's no one left to follow
There's nothing but the power to believe in me
I reach for what I know
When I can't see tomorrow
I carry hope

----------------------------------------
She has the wind as a witness
She has feelings that fly by night
She believes in forgiveness
But it's not love if it holds too tight
And you can fly beside her
But you gotta go when your heart says no
She lets the bright lights guide her
Through the rain and the drivin' snow
Where it comes from she don't know
She's a child of the wild blue yonder
Flying out of here
She's a child of the wild blue yonder
Born in an angel's tear
But if you see her falling
That's just a little trick she does
She makes a dive for the plain that's calling
Heads for the clouds like a little dove
She can't help her laughing
She can't stop your crying days
Sometimes it hurts to be having
That kinda love that bears away
She's a child of the wild blue yonder
Born in an angel's tear
She's a child of the wild blue yonder
Flying out of here
Medicine woman raised her
Spirit father praised her
Through their love she was set free
From a baby kicking and screaming
To a full blood woman dreaming
With the power just to be
She's a child of the wild blue yonder
Flying out of here
She's a child of the wild blue yonder
Born in an angel's tear
She's a child of the wild blue yonder
Flying out of here
She's a child of the wild blue yonder
Born in an angel's tear
She's a child of the wild blue yonder
She's a child of the wild blue yonder

De oorlog meegemaakt
Ik ben Jaap, ik ben je buurman
Tweeenzeventig jaar oud
Ik was twintig toen de mof kwam
Het was lente, het werd koud
Vijf jaar hebben wij geleden
Het land bezet, je hart gekraakt
Dus praat jij mij niet over vrede
Ik heb de oorlog, ik heb de oorlog meegemaakt
Ik ben een Ier, dus zeg maar Perry
Hoewel ik Sean heet in het echt
Sinds ik in Belfast ben geboren
Is het leven een gevecht
"Brits out", "Up the IRA"
Het zijn wat kreten die je slaakt
Maar als je aan de Sjenkil Road woont
Heb je de oorlog, heb je de oorlog meegemaakt
Noem mij maar Sophie als je wilt
Ik ben veertien, klein en blond
Ik woon nog steeds in Sarajewo
In een kelder, op de grond
Toen ik tien was klonken schoten
'k Had geluk, werd niet geraakt
Pas nu weet ik hoe vrede klinkt
'k Heb de oorlog meegemaakt
Ik ben Dolf, tweeendertig
'n trendy bril en piekig haar
Ik heb tv, ik lees de kranten
Je ziet geweld, gevecht, gevaar
Ik kijk het nieuws, dan ga ik slapen
Je vergeet totdat je weer ontwaakt
En heel soms droom ik zelfs van vrede
Ik heb de oorlog, ik heb de oorlog meegemaakt
Ik heb de oorlog meegemaakt
Ik heb de oorlog meegemaakt
Ik ben Jaap, ik ben je buurman
Ik heb de oorlog meegemaakt
Ik ben een Ier, dus zeg maar Perry
Ik heb de oorlog meegemaakt

O, ho

I refuse
To die, inside, again
I know what you're gonna say
I've seen what you do
I've been through this passion play
I've learned every move

You're lookin' like an angel, but a halo, doesn't make it true
My heart, you know, just doesn't wanna let you go
This game, insane, keep standing in the pouring rain
But, oohh, how I, how much I love (I do love to love you)
Don't know why, I die for love (I do love to love you)
How I cry, when I'm in love (I do love to love you)
Try and try, to stay in love (I do love to love you)
Some people say I'm stupid, shoot the cupid, with the attitude
Too late, to be protected, been injected, by a fix of you
I'll bust it outta rehab, flag the first cab, take it to your door
No matter how I fight it, can't deny it, comin' back for more
I fell, so deep, a kinda love that makes me weep
Your skin, my sin, but I would do it all again
'Cause, oohh, how I, how much I love (I do love to love you)
Don't know why, I die for love (I do love to love you)
How I cry, when I'm in love (I do love to love you)
Try and try, to stay in love (I do love to love you)
Nanana, nananana (I do love to love you)
Nanana, nananana (I do love to love you)
Nanana, nananana (I do love to love you)
Nanana, nananana (I do love to love you)
I let down my defenses, lose control of my senses
Boy, this love is expensive, but it's forever endless
Now I know there is no doubt, we will love 'till we bleed out
I do love, yeah, I love to love, to love you
Nanana, nananana (I do love to love you)
Nanana, nananana (I do love to love you)
Nanana, nananana (I do love to love you)
Nanana, nananana (I do love to love you)
Oohh, how I, how much I love (I do love to love you)
Don't know why, I die for love (I do love to love you)
How I cry, when I'm in love (I do love to love you)
Try and try, to stay in love (I do love to love you)
Nanana, nananana (I do love to love you)
Nanana, nananana (I do love to love you)

Don't you let go of me
No solid ground, no relief to be found
No promises, no demands, no depending
Silence, no rules, no bending
No mystery
There's only you
I live inside an empty room that's now inside my head
And everywhere and all around, only your arms that I feel
Don't you let go of me
No comfort, no words and no ending
Solitude, I am tired of pretending
Still there's only you
I live inside an empty room that's now inside my head
And everywhere and all around only your arms that I feel
Don't you let go of me
The ceiling high, the walls are wide, no floor beneath my feet
Nowhere to go, nowhere to be and you're still all that I see
Don't you let go of me
Be quiet, maybe you can hear my heart
Be quiet, maybe you won't break me apart
It's all down to you
It's all down to you
It's all down to you
It's all down to you
I live inside an empty room that's now inside my heart
And everywhere and all around, only your arms that I feel
Don't you let go of me
The ceiling high, the walls are wide, no floor beneath my feet
Nowhere to go,nowhere to be and you're still all that I see
Don't you let go of me
You're still all that I need
Don't you let go of me

Tonight I called out your name
The thought of you
Was carried on the wind
And it echoed through the canyon like a train
Winding on home to me again
I can almost touch your face
It's almost like your never went away
Everywhere I go
I can feel you all around me
In the sunrise, in the moonlight
I breathe you in like the air
You're everywhere
I walked through the forest green
Far from all the chaos and the noise
And the river she sang to me
I could swear it sounded like your voice
There to comfort me
Soothing as a gentle breeze
Everywhere I go
I can feel you all around me
In the sunrise, in the moonlight
I breathe you in like the air
You're everywhere
Everywhere I go
I can feel you all around me
In the sunrise, in the moonlight
I breathe you in like the air
Oh, I breathe you in like the air
You're everywhere

Eyes straight ahead
Save your words, don‚Äôt give them up
All of them are not enough
To make them see or understand
Sometimes the truth
Is a line, you walk a while
Just find you‚Äôre alone
Cause everybody thinks they know
Everything about it
Sticks and stones again and again
But everybody has to know
In the end the truth will show
Try to stay strong, until then
Keep your head up and eyes straight ahead
No winners here in this game
Of pushing guilt and passing blame
So stand aside and let it go
A better sky, is on its way
So please just try to sit and wait
I know it‚Äôs hard
Cause everybody thinks they know
Everything about it
Sticks and stones again and again
But everybody has to know
In the end the truth will show
Try to stay strong, until then
Keep your head up and eyes straight ahead of us
There is something we‚Äôre needing to find
Up ahead of us
Cause everybody thinks they know
Everything about it
Cause everybody thinks they know
Everything about it
Sticks and stones again and again
But everybody has to know
In the end the truth will show
Try to stay strong, until then
Keep your head up and eyes straight ahead

Fall
The floor looks better now, that I've swept the mess you made
I wish it was that easy, to wipe regret away
But you don't seem to mind 'cause you never have to touch
All the stains you leave behind, I keep picking up to
Fall, like the sky let's go of snow
Fall, like sunken ships on ocean floors
Fall, like the words we couldn't hold
We fall
I have boxes stored away underneath our bed
The things I once held dear, now hold dust instead
It's time to take them out and put them all outside
I wish it was that easy to clear my mind
I fall, like the sky let's go of snow
Fall, like sunken ships on ocean floors
Fall, like the words we couldn't hold
We fall
And every time I let you closer
I lose a part I won't get back
I'm feeling just a little older
Every time I fall
Fall, like the sky let's go of snow
Fall, like sunken ships on ocean floors
Fall, like the words we couldn't hold
We fall?

Far away
I've heard you talking in circles for some time now and
Every word has been well abused
It's so predictable, no surprise now
But I'll keep listening to you
Dig in, digging deep, shelter, cover me
Finding far away you
Dig in digging deep
Deeper into you
Finding far away me
You're taking walks up and down your mind
You're moving forward and then rewind
You just keep bending horizon's line
And I keep walking with you
Lost inside of you, inside of all I know
Where is it that we've gone
Lost inside of me
Is it misery that's blinded me
I cannot see
I watch you analyzing and drawning lines
No piece of paper will clarify
Where you're beginning and where you die
Inside
Lost inside of you, inside of all I know
Where is it that we've gone
Lost inside of me
Is it misery that's blinded me
I cannot see
Far far far away, far far far away
Far far far away, far far far away
Lost inside of you, inside of all I know
Where is it that we've gone
Lost inside of me
Is it misery that's blinded me
I cannot see
Far far far away, far far far away
Far far far away, far far far away
You're taking walks up and down your mind
You're moving forward an then rewind

And in the sticky heat I feel you open up to me
Love comes out of nowhere baby, just like a hurricane
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain
Underneath the stars, now baby, lying next to you
Wondering who you are now baby
And how do you do?
The clouds blowin' across the moon
And the wind howls out your name
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain
We'll never make that bridge tonight
Across lake Ponchartrain
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain
Batten down the hatches
But keep your heart on your sleeve
A little bit of stormy weather
That's no cause for us to leave
Just stay here darling, in my arms
Let it wash away the pain
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain
Like rain pouring down on me
It feels like rain
Raining down on me
Feels like rain

Flying Blind
I don't know where I'm going
It's an unchartered sky
I don't think I even really know
What I'm feeling inside
Love is so uncertain
Who can say what's in store
This is deeper, farther, higher
Than I'm been before
I'm flying blind
Wherever your love takes me
I'm letting go and I don't care if I fall
I close my eyes with you beside me
I follow faith and let it guide me
Tonight I'm leaving all my fears behind
I'm flying blind
I wont question tomorrow
It's a mystery to me
I just know what your touch in me does
I know this is where I wanna be
Its a risk worth taking
I dont want to come down
Play my heart
Got my cards on the table
Got my head up in the clouds
I'm flying blind
Wherever your love takes me
I'm letting go and I don't care if I fall
I close my eyes with you beside me
I follow faith and let it guide me
Tonight I'm leaving all my fears behind
I'm flying blind
I close my eyes with you beside me
I follow faith and let it guide me
Tonight I'm leaving all my fears behind
I'm flying blind
I'm flying blind

Lyrics
'Cross the Bering strait
to a foreign land
I took to the sky just like I planned
Left my old life behind
there in the ice and snow
followed a rainbow to Mexico
Somewhere this side of lucky just shy of goin' down
there's a pilot with her wings on fire
and she doesn't even notice,
she got magic on her mind
'cause she's flyin' solo for the first time
Chorus:
Flying solo
like an angel in the night
flyin' solo
across the great devide
I've been down so low, now I'm up so high
there ain't nothin' short of dying
is gonna make me change my mind
flyin' solo, flyin' solo
Like a fallin' leaf
I fell down from your tree
chalk one up to prosperity
in search of warmer waters
I'm like a bird gone south
don't know just what I'll find
but I'm finding out
Now here I'm dancin' with the moon
spinning out of control
never be the same again
'cause there's a place under the horizon
where it hardly ever rains
the sun is always shining
freedom is it's name
-  Chorus -
Around the world that's where I'll be
Amelia Earheart's got nothin' on me

Drop these walls, they have no meaning
Fold this world in two, and I‚Äôm right next to
You and me are never ending
Like the big bang out of nothing
Fold this world in two and

Well I've heard enough
And I've seen enough
And I know enough to know
I know a good thing when I see it
And it's a bad thing to let go
Well I've been around
I've been up and down
Until I bent out of control
With your world all in motion
You got to put a ball and a chain on your soul
All those angels runnin'
Picking up the pieces
Putting back together hearts broke long ago
I know a good thing when I see it
And it's a bad thing to let go
There will always be lovers
With borders of their own
And you may charge across
In a golden chariot
I had dreams like distant thunder
I had hope like a prayer unheard
Now this is nothing
Less than perfect
In a less than perfect world
All those angels
Picking up the pieces
Putting back together hearts broke long ago
I know a good thing when I see it
And it's a bad thing to let go
I know a good thing when I see it
And it it's a bad thing to let go

I feel no pain
My heart stopped, unchosen
Like snow I fade away
My arms, weak with emptiness
My soul sleeps, I'm heavenless
There's no sky above me
Still shadows I can see
The darkness took over
And left me free
No laughter
No tenderness
Hereafter
Is heavenless
Alone, I see is freezing me
The ice runs deep inside of me
The earth spins beneath me
As lifetimes slip away

Becoming yesterday
Afraid I'll die of loneliness
I'm scared that I am heavenless

Hurricane
Tick tack on the wall, screaming out a silent call
Could this be another warning
Higher pressure¬¥s got me falling
Into worlds I¬¥ve never seen
Seemed so far away from me
I always ran away from the storm.
Maybe i haven¬¥t cried enough tears
Maybe i haven¬¥t laughed out loud
Maybe i have been stuck in amber
Just a part of the crowd.
Nothing¬¥s wrong, nothing¬¥s changed
here in the eye of the hurricane
Strong enough to take the pain
Far from the eye of the hurricane.
Tick tack on the wall, could this be my wake-<wbr>up call
Hiding underneath the sheets
I wait for life to come to me
Think it¬¥s time i break these patterns
Systematic comes a habit
Am i strong enough to believe.
Maybe i haven¬¥t cried enough tears
Maybe i haven¬¥t laughed out loud
Maybe i have been stuck in amber
Just a part of the crowd.
Nothing¬¥s wrong, nothing¬¥s changed
here in the eye of the hurricane
Strong enough to take the pain
Far from the eye of the hurricane
Carry on, carry on, Just to get along
Carry on, carry on, Just to get along
Carry on, carry on, Just to get along
Carry on, carry on, Just to get along
Nothing¬¥s wrong, nothing¬¥s changed

Darling you, nearly had me this time
But there for a moment
I almost believed
A wishful thinking got the better of me
And hope of the heart, a true heart is hoping
The easier it's deceived
But there for a moment, I almost believed
For a second, all was forgiven
It's a dangerous thing we all do
For own good faith
All is ready to giving
Wanting so bad for something good to be true
But there for a moment
I almost believed
A wishful thinking got the better of me
And hope of the heart, a true heart is hoping
The easier it's deceived
Well there for a moment, I almost believed
I came so close, to falling so far
Until my mind chose, not to follow my heart
But there for a moment
I almost believed
A wishful thinking got the better of me
And hope of the heart, a true heart is hoping
The easier it's deceived
Well there for a moment, I almost believed
Well there for a moment, I almost believed
I almost believed

I always will
I've always liked the wind
I stood tall and let it pass
Because I knew there would be silence after all
I was calm
I've always liked the water
All my life it ran through me
I could trust it
I knew I'd always float
And the tide would bring me home
You know I love you and I always will
But you're like the strongest wind that never passes
You know I want you and I always will
You're like the roughest sea
No tide to bring me home
You know I need you and I always will
Am I just too weak?
Or are you just too strong for me?
I've always liked the taste of danger
I've always let it challenge me
But inside there was a thin white line
I stayed safe within its borders
I was fine
You know I love you and I always will
Darker than my fears
No safety net to catch us
You know I want you and I always will
You go beyond
To where there is nothing left of me
You know I need you and I always will
Am I just too weak?
Or are you just too strong for me?
Who's too strong for who?
Who's too weak for who?
You know I love you and I always will
But you're like the strongest wind that never passes
You know I want you and I always will
You're like the roughest sea
No tide to bring me home
You know I need you and I always will
There's no good in this; all this holding on
You know I want you and I always will
All this trying on my own
I am always on my own
You know I need you and I always will
Am I just too weak?
Or are you just too strong for me?
Who's too strong for who?

I didn't mean to be so cold
Like your arms had never hold me
Like a story never told
But you know exactly how it goes
Still you carry on with pride
When you touch me you're so tenderly
All the pain you keep inside
Wouldn't stop you from defending me
Always remembering
I love you
Your love's stronger than I can deny
I love you
Your faith kept us safe
Between two hearts you'll never find
A deeper understanding
There's no use in asking why
When the answer is right before my eyes
And I finally realize
I love you
Your love's stronger than I can deny
I love you
Your faith kept us safe
I didn't mean to be so cold
I didn't mean to be so cold
I didn't mean to be so cold
I didn't mean to be so cold
I didn't mean to be so cold
I love you
Your love's stronger than I can deny

I say you name out of habit
I forgot that you don‚Äôt hear me anymore
The silence feels so heavy
I try to carry on
Sometimes I think that I see you
I remember I don‚Äôt have you anymore
The space, it feels so empty
I try to carry on
I need for you
Heart beats for you
Lungs breathe for you
I know you have to leave
But don‚Äôt leave me alone
Cause I am nothing but a hollow body,
When you go
I need for you
We used to share every morning
Now most days I end up keeping to myself
Cause it‚Äôs easier to handle
When I‚Äôm barely hanging on
When people come here to talk
I just listen, cause I don‚Äôt know what to say
No words for what I‚Äôm feeling
I‚Äôm barely hanging on
I need for you
Heart beats for you
Lungs breathe for you
I know you have to leave
But don‚Äôt leave me alone
Cause I am nothing but a hollow body,

I need for you
I need for you
Heart beats for you

I know you have to leave

I'm making flowers out of paper
While darkness takes the afternoon
I know that they won't Previous forever
But real ones fade away too soon
I still cry sometimes when I remember you
I still cry sometimes when I hear your name
I said goodbye and I know you're alright now
But when the leaves start falling down I still cry
It's just that I recall September
It's just that I still hear your song
It's just I can't seem to remember
Forever more those days are gone
I still cry sometimes when I remember you
I still cry sometimes when I hear your name
I said goodbye and I know you're alright now
But when the leaves start falling down I still cry
I still cry sometimes when I rememeber you
I still cry sometimes when I hear your name
I said goodbye and I know you're alright now
But when the leaves start falling down I still cry
But when the leaves start falling down I still cry

I'd be yours
If I were a ghost I'd haunt your house
Hang out in your rafters
You could be my mister adams I could be your casper
I'd share with you my afterlife of the unexplained
Walk through your walls let you ratle my chains
Yes I would
And if I were snake I'd be a constictor
Slicker than oil
I'd entice you with my slither wrap your in my coils
You could tie me in a thousand knots
And just watch me unfold
Hypnotize you with my stare swallow you whole
think about it
chorus:
Welcome to my world of make believe
Check your reality at the door
Within my wishes and my wildest dreams
If I could be anything
Well baby, I'd be yours
And if I were a bird I'd be an owl
Wise beyond my years
Watch over you each night, calm you of your fears
You could set my head to spinning
With those little things you do
Like saying it was me you loved
When I asked you who
Welcome to my world of make believe
Check your reality at the door
Within my wishes and my wildest dreams
If I could be anything
Well baby, I'd be yours
I‚Äôd be yours

I'll know you in the morning when I watch you waking up
I'll know your every wish before you say a word
Before you whisper it my heart will have already heard
Like we were born to be, like we met long ago, I'll know,
So close your eyes tonight and dream a dream with me
Every new morning-<wbr>light brings you closer to me
Come to me, I'll be here, 'cross the miles, 'cross the tears

Lyrics
I can almost read your mind, it's runnin' fast,
Out of control
You're afraid of what you'll find,
If you get too close
You imagine I don't care,
You see walls that just aren't there
You think I'm too strong to let you in
Well that's just not fair
Chorus:
I'm not so tough,
I'll call you bluff
And let you see a side of me
That wants you near and cries real tears
And needs someone to love
I'm not so tough
I know that you've been hurt before
Well so have I,
What can we do?
That doesn't mean you close the door
So stop blamin' me,
I don't blame you
I'm not some ghost from your past
The one who tore your heart in half
I'm not her, it's not my fault you're holding on to that
Repeat Chorus (3x)
I'm not so tough

I see all that I ever wanted
When you look at me like you do
I'd love to believe you've got all I need
But there's something missing in you
chorus:
If you had the heart to go with those eyes
I'd fall for you and never think twice
I'd trust those lips that tell such sweet lies
If you had the heart to go with those eyes
It's easy to see that you thrill me
But I know your story so well
You think hearts are for breaking
and love's made for taking
You give nothing at all of yourself
chorus:
If you had the heart to go with those eyes
I'd fall for you and never think twice
I'd trust those lips that tall such sweet lies
If you had the heart to go with those eyes
If you had the heart

You took it to heart
That is my love
And I thank heaven that I found you

Well it might sound strange
But after the hurting is all done
Here comes a change
So I went down into myself
Where any fool could see
All the love I had give to you
Wasn't gettin' out of me
It was an inside job
Baby we worked it out
It was an inside job
Baby we worked it out
I didn't know just what went wrong
All of my lights went out when you were gone
I called and you came
Right to my side
But you couldn't help me, sweet baby
It was my pride
So I went down into myself
Where any fool could see
All the love I had to give you
Wasn't getting out of me
It was an inside job
Baby we worked it out
It was an inside job
Baby we worked it out
Lost and alone, but now I've found
Well, it's from the inside out
The walls come tumblin' down
I didn't surrender, but now I see
Baby when I turn my love over
Sweet love comes back to me
So I went down into myself
Where any fool could see
All the love I had to give you
Wasn't gettin' out of me

That girl you were seein' back in '72
Somethin' 'bout a hotel room and bath water in your shoes
Were you into your Catholic thing then or some other stew
Were you both holed up in that hotel room practising voodoo
It'll come to you
Don't look back, it'll come to you
In the middle of the night, with you covers pulled up tight
It is gonna come to you
And that business partner you took for every red cent
You can't even remember where all of that money went
Some on liquor and women, maybe a little rent
But as far as paying it back, buddy, you ain't made a dent
It'll come to you
Don't look back, it'll come to you
In the middle of the night, with you covers pulled up tight
It is gonna come to you
Yes they'll all be standin' 'round you in your sleep
Askin' for a promise you couldn't keep
'Cause back when you were hollow inside
You were tryin' to puff yourself up with your own foolish pride
Now you're happily married, you've got a wife and kids of your own
But sometimes in the closet at night you can hear them rattlin' bones
Takin' bets on your future and your current postal zone
It's a spooky equation, but check out yourself Jack
You're the great unknown
It'll come to you
Don't look back, it'll come to you
In the middle of the night, with you covers pulled up tight
It is gonna come to you
Yeah, in the middle of the night, with you covers pulled up tight
It is gonna come to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Our summer nights
Graffiti with flash lights
I held on tight
Riding with you on your bike
Our secret place
Bubble gum in cherry taste
I left a trace
My lipstick on your face
Neon sound
Flashing rebels from the underground
We were wild, we were young and proud
And we did it side by side,
We did it side by side
Do you remember it
We were just kids
Living the thrill of it, for the thrill of it
Do you remember it
We were just kids
Living the thrill of it, for the thrill of it
Kings and queens
In tank-<wbr>taps and ripped up jeans
Video dreams
Baby, it was you and me
We were alone
Mix tape from the radio
Tangled up so close
You and me and my headphones
Neon sound
Flashing rebels from the underground
We were wild, we were young and proud
And we did it side by side,
We did it side by side
Do you remember it

Just like the moon
I sat outside one afternoon
In an old lawn chair
And I watched the sun set off
For business West somewhere
Wile the sky turned watercolor pink
And gold and blue
And the stars all showed up one by one
And we waited for the moon
And I thought ‚Äòbout you and I wondered why
It took so long to say goodbye
You shined so bright you blinded me
And left me so I couldn‚Äòt see dat
chorus:
I was the moon chasing the sun
There was never a prayer of ever catching up
No matter how fast I would run
Like the moon chasing the sun
Just like the moon chasing the sun
The crickets called
And the moon peeked out of the Eastern sky
They both start up about this time each night
And an evening breeze stopped by
And brought some sweet relief
In the silver light I finally let go of the heat
And I thought ‚Äòbout you and I wondered why
It took so long to say goodbye
You shined so bringht you blinded me
And left me so I couldn‚Äòt see
(chorus)

There‚Äôs been a lot of miscommunication lately
A lot of wait and see and too many maybes
And I wanna believe that your faith in me is as strong as it was when we thought we‚Äôd be unbreakable
All the words we say end up distorted
From skin break to heartache without warning
And you don‚Äôt mean it and I don‚Äôt either, we get so close to being defeated by circumstance
Do we stand a chance
To rise above it all
But I feel so small
Lay your weapons down
And I‚Äôll take my armor off
Say what we need to say
And love before it‚Äôs lost
‚ÄòCause what we have is real
And real can hurt sometimes
But just because it hurts doesn‚Äôt mean that we say goodbye
So lay your weapons down
Feel so uncomfortable in this silence
Behind these invisible walls we build inside us
So what‚Äôs gonna give and what will it take for us to admit that we‚Äôre both gonna break if we stay right here
Don‚Äôt wanna stay right here
Lay your weapons down
And I‚Äôll take my armor off
Say what we need to say
And love before it‚Äôs lost
‚ÄòCause what we have is real
And real can hurt sometimes
But just because it hurts doesn‚Äôt mean that we say goodbye
So lay your weapons down
I wanna rise above it all
Will you hold me, just hold me
And lay your weapons down
And I‚Äôll take my armor off
Say what we need to say
And love before it‚Äôs lost
‚ÄòCause what we have is real
And real can hurt sometimes
But just because it hurts doesn‚Äôt mean that we say goodbye

Run and get your life coat, this ain‚Äôt no love boat,
I already left that sinking ship
So if you try to hold me down, get off boy
Cause I‚Äôm finally learning to swim
If you try to hold me down, get off boy

Let go
I come from right
You go to left and I
Feel like you've built a wall
And I'm outside
I try to talk
But you don't hear what I say
There's too much room between us
When I try to fly
And get up real high
Your silence pulls me down
Why don't you just let go
Why not turn out the light
Why don't you close the door completely
If we're already too far gone
Why leave me hanging on to you
All you gotta do is let go
Look where we are
See what we have become
You've got to know I'm hurting
More and more
Just say the words
'Cause the longer time stands still
Makes it hard for you to leave
And for me to live
When I try to fly
Up real high
Your silence pulls me down
Why don't you just let go
Why not turn out the light
Why don't you close the door completely
If we're already too far gone
Why leave me hanging on to you
All you gotta do is let go
Let go of me
If we‚Äôre already too far gone
Why leave me hanging on to you
All you gotta do is let go
Let go of me
Let go

Livin' on love
I didn't know I was getting into
When I got my first taste of you
You were just what I was lookin' for
And once I had a little I had to have more
'Cause I'd wake up moanin' in the middle of the night
The sound of your name was all that sounded right
Ran back to your door all soaked with sweat
Had to have your kiss before I starved to death
When you're livin' on love, and it's all you need
A constant hunger that you've got to feed
Livin' on love, and there ain't no doubt
It's the one thing that you can't live without
You can have the world
But you still wouldn't have enough
None of that matters when you're livin' on love
Nothing else matters when you're livin' on love
Some folks just don't seem to understand
How I seem to survive on the touch of your hand
I don't need to eat, I don't need no rest
If I can get my fill of your tenderness
When I get wore down and feelin' rough
A long cool drink from your lovin' cup
Makes me feel better, makes me feel strong
Have mercy on me if I find you gone
Livin' on love, and it's all you need
A constant hunger that you've got to feed
Livin' on love, and there ain't no doubt
It's the one thing that you can't live without
You can have the world
But you still wouldn't have enough
None of that matters when you're livin' on love
Nothing else matters when you're livin' on love
Hey yeah yeah yeah!
Livin' on love, and it's all you need
A constant hunger that you've got to feed
Livin' on love, and there ain't no doubt
It's the one thing that you can't live without
Livin' on love
Livin' on love
Livin' on love
Livin' on love, livin' on love
Livin' on love, livin' on love, livin' on love
Hey, hey yeah

Lonely too
How can you ask me
How have I been
I think you should know well
The shape that I‚Äôm in
You say that you wondered
If I was o.k.
Well that‚Äôs a damn fool thing to say
The water is risin‚Äô
The water is wide
And your always standin‚Äô
On the other side
And then comes the moment
I wake before dawn
With hours to lie here alone
And you seem so surprised
That I‚Äôm feelin‚Äô this way
How am I so lonely today
If you ever loved me the way I loved you
You would be lonely too
So here‚Äôs to the lovers
For old times sake
Who don‚Äôt hold each other
To the promise they break
And smile through the window
And wave on the street
‚ÄòCause that‚Äôs all you want now from me
Should I say something
To put you at ease
Or should I get down on my knees
If you ever loved me the way I loved you
You would be lonely too
If you ever loved me the way I loved you
You would be lonely too

Sweet touch of citrus skin
I watch you peeling mandarins
As gently as the day begins
I cover up the shade we're in
And I retrace what brought us here
Cigarettes and cheap dead beer
The fresh air in that atmosphere
We talk but never hear
Guess I don't know you at all
All I know is
Love won't hide away
If it's right I know we'll find a way
Darling stay, but if you think that you must leave
It's not a thought that worries me
'Cause love don't hide away
Love don't hide away
We're like flowers in the grass
Without the rain we cannot Previous
Clouds bring dark but they will pass
We're just storming in a glass
That's chipped and cracked and bound to break
And when it does, it's still ok 
'Cause we could use the luck it brings
At this point I'll take anything
'Cause I don't know you at all
All I know is
Love won't hide away
If it's right I know we'll find a way
Darling stay, but if you think that you must leave
It's not a thought that worries me
'Cause love don't hide away
Love don't hide away
If I could buy the words I need to say
I save it all to spent my life away
'Cause all I want is just to have your love
Love don't hide away
If it's right I know we'll find a way
No, love won't hide away
If it's right I know we'll find a way
Darling stay, but if you think that you must leave
It's not a thought that worries me
'Cause love don‚Äôt hide away
Love don‚Äôt hide away
Love don‚Äôt hide away?
Love won't hide

You can't hide the darker side of you
You can't disguise a lie and call it truth
You neglect resposibility
And sacrifice your dignity
You do it all so shamelessly
Your motivation is your bottom line
It's not enough to take what yours
You take what's mine
Your religion's kind of funny
It sees you worship money
Heartless and mechanical soul
Machine people
Industrial disease
Machine people
Is it worth
Losing your humanity
I'm almost glad that I found out
What you've become
I can live without
Was I just to blind to see
Your lack of morality
It's painfully obvious now

Takes a little time
And a sense of wrong and right

Magic
Power takes a wicked hold
Old rules, the art of terror
Cowboys and the theme of war
High cost of trial and error
The killing crisis takes its toll
It‚Äôs criminal madness
Break it down
Make it so you see it all
It‚Äôs magic
Take it down
Shake it till the curtain falls
It‚Äôs magic
(Break it down)
Money makes a refugee
Wall street, the rogues of ruin
A labor hero‚Äôs legacy
All wiped out by the wrecking crew and
Selling everything must go
It‚Äôs sexy when there‚Äôs so much sadness
Take it down
Make it so you see it all
It‚Äôs magic
Take it down
Shake it till the curtain falls
It‚Äôs magic
Down to dept, volunteer to victim
Place your bet, no one‚Äôs gonna miss them
Greed just wants to make you crowl
A deficit of heart and soul
If only that they had this
Break it down
Make it so you see it all
It‚Äôs magic

Shake it till the curtain falls

As I sit here below the light
And write these words to you
And I'm thinking how time just flies
Years of yesterdays all feel like they're new
I remember those cold cold nights
Felt like they started at noon
We only saw pitch black
Not the man in the moon
Now we look from the outside
We've distanced the pain
We've boxed disappointments and put them away
We don't cry anymore
And every once in a while there's a smile
Now don't let expectations
Fill the room of your heart
It'll shape it and break it
Till we've drifted apart
Now we look from the outside
We've distanced the pain
We've boxed disappointments and put them away
We don't cry anymore
And every once in a while there's a smile
Now we look from the outside
We've distanced the pain
We've boxed disappointments and put them away
We don't cry anymore
And every once in a while
Now there's a smile here this afternoon
As I write these words to you
In a while, with our hope renewed
We look up to sky
Just you and I
And the man in the moon

Take on this mission, take the challenge, walk the line

This is the moment, still the hunger, dry my eyes
And all the no-<wbr>s and all the doubts are out of sight
Free of insecurities, I will not hide
All that was and used to be, is not denied
Wait you turn, be polite, miss politician
Or you'll get burned if you speak too soon, what a transmission
Pay your debts, get a return, it's in the favors now
Who do you know, mind the gap, miss politician
The bigger name, the busy traffic, no more time
What doe you want, if you are desperate, stand in the line
Let's analyze you situation, let's define
Go face yourself and realize all that is true
And don't give up, just stick with me, I'll stick to you
This is a game, not serious, so what you do
Wait your turn, be polite, miss politician
Or you'll get burned if you speak too soon, what a transmission
Pay your debts, get a return, it's in the favors now

I've been lookin' at you, lookin' at me
And somethin' tells me that
This could be a once in forever thing
So why are you holdin' back?
No more smoke and mirrors
I need to know how deep you feel
If you really want me baby
If you really want me, yeah
Wrap me up, get too close
Completely let yourself let go
Bare your soul, go too far
With your love stripped down, no walls, no bars
Baby come to me
With a naked heart
I have had more than my share of secrets and lies
And calculated mysteries
So this time I need to be sure you're mine
Truly, honestly
Surrender, don't just hold me
To really love me you got to show me
You're strong enough now baby
To let yourself be weak
Wrap me up, get too close
Completely let yourself let go
Bare your soul, go too far
With your love stripped down, no walls no bars
Baby come to me
With a naked heart
Wrap me up, get too close
Completely let yourself let go
Bare your soul, go too far
With your love stripped down, no walls no bars
Baby come to me
With a naked heart
Naked heart

I saw the sunrise on the hill
And at once I remembered how it felt
To feel warm and safe inside
It was like waking for the first time
In a long time and in my mind
The seasons changed and winter died
Bye, bye
My world is brighter
My view much wider
New beginning
First breath of air, I'm so aware of
New beginning
I'm thankful for the chance to start again
I've turned the page
A change came with the wind
It's not the end 
It's a new beginning
After the rain washed my soul
And turned a bitterness to innocence, I knew
The path was open to move on
Allow me to offer me your hand
And let me introduce myself again
The girl I used to be is gone, so long
My world is brighter
My view much wider
New beginning
First breath of air, I'm so aware of
New beginning
I'm thankful for the chance to start again
I've turned the page
A change came with the wind
It's not the end 
It's a new beginning
Got a new state of mind
I left that other world behind me
It‚Äôs been a long hard climb
But on this mountaintop
Is where you'll find me
New beginning
First breath of air, I'm so aware of
New beginning
I'm thankful for the chance to start again
I've turned the page
A change came with the wind

He loves his woman
I swear that's true
But the devil inside of him
still wants her too
when they're together
don't know right from wrong
no piece inside of him
when she's gone
one more kissing then
you say goodbye
one last hold me tight
one tender smile
cause all alone
just can't be true
one more kissing then
no more you
This dangerous game they play
can't go on
but as they always say
it's easier said then done
they must gain control
of their life that's why
this means for both of them
the end of the line
one more kissing then

one last hold me tight

Now baby we should go back
To where we started from
I know we feel the reasons
Let's speak them out and run
Let's not let confusion cover up the shine
There's no use in denial
We can't reinvent this time
Look me in the eyes
(Look me in the eyes)
And see my love
(Look me in the eyes and see my love)
Take me by my hand
(Take me by my hand)
And you'll know why
It's just me and you
(It's me and you)
And there's no reason to
(No reason to)
Be shy
We'll bring back all the colours
And paint outside of your lines
Use the pieces of this picture
Like a poet uses rhyme
Recapture all the passion, play a lovers' game
To not would be a crime
To wait would be a shame
Look me in the eyes
(Look me in the eyes)
And see my love
(Look me in the eyes and see my love)
Take me by my hand
(Take me by my hand)
And you'll know why
It's just me and you
(It's me and you)
And there's no reason to
(No reason to)
Be shy
Let it go
You will see
Follow your heart
Look me in the eyes
(Look me in the eyes)
And see my love
(Look me in the eyes and see my love)
Take me by my hand
(Take me by my hand)
And you'll know why
It's just me and you
(It's me and you)
And there's no reason to
(No reason to)
Be shy
We know what to do
There's no reason to be shy
You don‚Äôt have to be shy
You don't have to be...
Shy
Shy, oh
No reason to be shy

If we could look down from above
Would we see constellations of
You and me revolving around
Our own lives
Are we like stars, set in our way
Only to fall and burn one day
Do we shine, not knowing
Our own light
What is forever
When every sky shows
As soon as one light's out
Another one glows
All of us wonder
Where do we go
Is it dark, is it light
Nobody really knows
When we wish upon a star
For our souls to meet again afar
Does it come true or is it just
A nursery rhyme
And when my time on earth is done
Is a shooting star what I become
Was an impression made
Or do I just fade from your mind
So what is forever
When every sky shows
As soon as one light's out
Another one glows
All of us wonder
Where do we go
Is it dark, is it light

So make up your mind
Look ahead
You're behind
If you wait to see
When your mind's free of doubt
What's left to believe
There's no one that can tell you
So you decide
I've tried
Oh I've tried
I was stuck in this hole
With my face to the ground
Love, let me go
And I'm not waiting for you
Not waiting for you
In your eyes
I can see
What's missing inside
You get high
Not on me
Just along for the ride
It's not easy to ignore you
And your foolish pride
But I'll try
I'll try
I was stuck in this hole
With my face to the ground
Love, let me go
And I'm not waiting for you
Not waiting for you
I'll go cause I can't wait to see

Nothing left to break
Can't control this feeling, it breaks the shelter that you're in
And you can't make it disappear, or pretend that it's not there
When it's broken through your skin
When you're seeing for the first time
That you're standing on the front line
There's no way back
There's no one to save you now
If you choose love then let it in
But if you don't want the fight
Then why are you waiting
Turn around if that's what makes it right
Don't leave this mistake
'Till there's nothing left to break
Everyone is watching, waiting for your move
Frightened of the consequence, you don't move at all
'Cause you're too afraid to lose
When you're seeing for the first time
That you're standing on the front line
There's no way back
No one to save you now
If you choose love then let it in
But if you don't want the fight
Then why are you waiting
Turn around if that's what makes it right
Don't leave this mistake
'Till there's nothing left to break
Find what's true, inside out
To get to you, there's no way out
If you can't be, if you don't see
Let it go
But if you choose love then let it in
But if you don't want the fight
Then why are you waiting
Turn around if that's what makes it right

I can't stop this rain that's got to poor

I'm crying old tears
The dam is breaking after all these years
And you know what... I don't care
I don't care who sees me cry
I've been so strong
But there's no way that I can move on
No. this pain will never disappear
Until I cry this old tears
Just the little things
The sound of your name
I start to feel this ache inside my soul
I try to lock it all in,push it al down
It's just so hard to keep it in control
I could fill the ocean baby, I'm so blue
The only way that I'll get over losing you

Open je ogen
Er valt licht in mij naar binnen,
ze staat naast mij met haar tas.
Alsof er iets open gaat, iets wat er nog niet was.
En al denk ik, nee dat weet ik,
Ook al is het nog maar klein.
Het staat in steen gehouwen
Ik moet nergens anders zijn.
Ze kijkt heel lang naar de wolken,
En dan kijkt ze naar mij.
Alsof ze nu iets nieuws ziet,
alsof er iets aan haar verschijnt.
En dan lacht ze, en dan straalt ze 
En niemand hier is vrij.
Ik kan maar niet begrijpen
hoe ze zo zichzelf kan zijn
Dus open je ogen voor mij
Loop je geluk niet voorbij.
Dus open je ogen voor mij
Loop je geluk niet voorbij.
Er staat nooit iets in de sterren,
wat een mens niet goed verstaat.
Alsof elke vorm van uitleg
het veel te moeilijk maakt.
En je voelt het, 
en je ziet het,
en je weet dat het zo is.
Je kunt niet meer begrijpen
Dat je nooit iets hebt gemist.
Dus open je ogen voor mij.
Loop je geluk niet voorbij.
Iets bijzonders, heel eenvoudig.
Het gebeurt de hele tijd
Tot een donderslag bij heldere hemel
Want vandaag gebeurt het mij.

Oud geboren
Waarom word je niet oud geboren?
Zodat het leukste nog komen gaat
Alles ging dan achterstevoren
En was te vroeg te laat
Dan was je je onschuld nooit verloren
Kreeg je die juist aan het einde terug
En was je wijsheid aangeboren
Je toekomst al achter de rug
Je elke dag weer iets na√Øever bent
En alles is leuk, want je bent niets gewend
Tegen het einde goedgelovig en klein
Zodat ik niet als de dood voor de dood hoef te zijn
Dan zag je je lijf steeds sterker worden
Had je je jeugd nog voor de boeg
Alles kwam goed wat ooit ontspoorde
En was te laat te vroeg
Als ik dan zestien ben geworden
Voer ik m‚Äôn laatste strijd
Verlies ik opnieuw mijn wilde haren
Maar nu in de pubertijd
Beter nog, ik wil heen en weer
Bijna sterven en dan nog een keer
Hoe het ook gaat, ik wil een zachte dood
Zodat ik kan slapen, ik kan slapen, ik kan slapen in m‚Äôn moeders schoot

Paper plane
Always reaching out for the higher places
But that doesn‚Äôt mean that I‚Äôm unsatisfied
Coming from the rivers and the open spaces
I have been a child under painted skies
I don‚Äôt wanna be the one that rests in safety
Dancing on the edge of a borderline
Searching for adventure and a different playground
Unfamiliar tapestry, a newborn sound, a newborn sound, a newborn sound
Feeling like a little girl that plays with water
Take it everywhere, never mind the mess
I was feeling filthy rich with just three quarters
Happy hunting, bouncing heart inside my chest, inside my chest
Oh oh, fold a paper plane, come fly me through the grey, to a color rainbow
Oh oh, how far can I go, throw me like stone, skipping cross the water
La la la la la
Palm tree, rodeo, starry pavement
Tinsel town, tumbleweed, rolling dice
The Grand Canyon whispers to the gold rush mountains
Waterfall, sugar cane, paradise, paradise
Oh oh, fold a paper plane, come fly me through the grey, to a color rainbow
Oh oh, how far can I go, throw me like stone, skipping cross the water
La la la la la
The river‚Äôs wide
It can be wider baby
Just don‚Äôt you hide away your longing, longing
Oh oh, fold a paper plane, fly me through the grey, to a color rainbow
Oh oh, how far can I go, throw me like stone skipping cross the water
Oh oh, canvas on the floor, I paint an open door to the secret places
Oh oh, nowhere I won‚Äôt go, far beyond the road to the lost horizon
La la la la, how far can I go
La la la la, like a skipping stone
La la la la, far beyond the road

When the sun comes up 
On another day
And the sidewalk shines
And the streetlight way
In the autumn wind
Hard, like the times
I'll dream of yours
Peaceful in mine
And when the stars
Fall out of sight
A flame will burn
In a frozen night
With a simple wish
In these violent times
To dream of yours
Peaceful in mine
There we walk down that road again
Innocent strangers
Eternal friends
In a word of our very own
Far from space and time
With yours peaceful in mine
So wait for me
Up there tonight
And we'll dance on
Till the morning left
Leaving all but faith behind
And yours peaceful in mine
With a simple wish in these crazy times
And yours
Peaceful in mine
Peaceful in mine

Pirate of your soul
This story I'm lying in
Feels like a guilty sin
I'll be your alibi
If you're mine, if you're mine
Addictive medicine
Your fingers on my skin
One reckless word spoken
And it's done, it's done
And carry me away
No one has to know
Find the hidden place
Where they go
I'll be the pirate of your soul
So count me in -<wbr> one, two, three
Reveal this mystery
The strangest melody
In my mind, in my mind
So get me up, spin me round
Let me flow on this cloud
Don't let the stars fall out
Of your eyes, of your eyes
And carry me away
No one has to know
Find the hidden place
Where they go, where we go
And catch me in the moon
Underneath the sun
Don't wake up too soon
In your dreams
I'll be the pirate of your soul
(One, two, three)
I'll be the pirate of your soul

So carry me away
No one has to know

And don't wake up too soon

So I stay the way I am
Just a crooked little outline
I'm whole, then not, and back again
Wondering when I'll ever find
Someone who will take the time
Puzzle me
Spread my heart out on your floor
The pieces now are yours to put in place
Rearrange, 'cause I'm scattered, undefined
Hanging on by borderlines
'Till you complete
You puzzle me
Pick me up, lay me down
Your touch
It has turned me round
Over time, patiently
All the little clues you found
Have shapened up to show
You've pulled me together
We fit and we both know
Everything is better now
Everything is better
Puzzle me
Spread my heart out on your floor
The pieces now are yours to put in place
Rearrange, 'cause I'm scattered, undefined
Hanging on by borderlines
'Till you complete

And everything about me, suddenly made clear
The empty spaces disappear, they disappear
Puzzle me
Spread my heart out on your floor

I've seen your dreams get broken
I've heard your words unspoken
And sometimes hope is layin' low
Hidden in the ashes
Left after the fire
In my heart I see you run free
Like a river down to the sea
All the chains that held you down
Will be in pieces on the ground
You'll drink the rain and ride the wind to me
I've seen a faithless lover
Take you down to deep water
And I have watched a fragile wing
Tangled up in longings get broken in the struggle
In my heart I see you run free
Like a river down to the sea
All the chains that held you down
Will be in pieces on the ground
You'll drink the rain and ride the wind to me
Someday your tears will turn to daimonds
With a kiss you'll wake to see
That you're strong at the broken places
I know someday you'll go free
In my heart I see you run free
Like a child you were meant to be
All the chains that held you down
Will be in pieces on the ground
You'll drink the rain and ride the wind to me

Riding with the king
I dreamed I did a good job and I got well paid
I blew it all at the penny arcade
A hundred dollars on a kewpie doll
I guess no white chick is gonna make him crawl
On a TWA, to the promised land
Everybody come on clap your hands
Don't you just love the way he sings
Don't you know we're riding with the king?
He's on a mission of mercy to the new frontier
He's gonna check us all on out of here
Up to that mansion on a hill
Where you can get your prescription filled
On a TWA to the promised land
Every woman, child and man
A cadillac or a diamond ring
Don't you know we're riding with the king?
A red cape and his shiny cold 45
I never saw his face but I saw the light
Tonight everybody's getting angel wings
Don't you know we're riding with the king?
Well I was just about ten years old
When I stepped out of that mirror
I had a suit cut sharp
Like a razor and a heart of gold
I had a guitar hanging just about waist high
I'm gonna play that thing until I die
We're riding with the king

We couldn't decide on
Who was going to drive tonight
So I guess he felt the tension
From his side of this taxi-<wbr>ride
Asking us where we're headed for
And if we were both alright
I said, just drive
I...I still shine
With every passing neon sign
I took everything inside
I still shine
I take my coat and I go where I always go
Guess that I'll pay for the ride
Right or wrong, it's the same old song
'Cause you never try
Shut up 'cause you never listen
You're selfish and conceited and
Man you never compromise
Well I still shine
I...I still shine
If you'd rather be alone just take
Your torments and go on
I still shine
Shine all you want but you don't taste
Like you used to
You can cry all you want but you don't
Bring me down like you used to
You never gave me credits for the things I did for you
I'm alright, I'm alright
I...I still shine
With every passing neon sign
I took everything inside
I still shine

Come little darling run through the snow
Lights in your eyes, they keep out the cold
Dreams come and go
So run little darling, go
Somewhere tonight
Someone is crying
So let's dry their eyes
And pray for snow tonight
I hope your wishes, all do come true
Carry these memories inside of you 
Love all your life
That's my wish for you tonight
I hope you try
To see through the eyes
Of the child that's inside
Who prayed for snow 
Tonight, feels like time is standing still
Tonight you can't wait until
The light shows you that your world is dressed in white
So bright
Come little darling run through the snow
Lights in your eyes, they keep out the cold
Dreams come and go
One day I know
That I have to let go
And I'll say
‚ÄúRun little darling, go‚Äù

Watch me slip between the cracks

There's your hand
So incredible
The love we have, the things we hold
Let's make them Previous
You pull me through when I get stuck
In all the little distractions
So incredible
In the middle of the night
When the stars all gather
They conspire with the sky
I'm sure it's me they're after
Try to steal away my dreams
And keep them for themselves
As I'm stirring in my sleep
Please just help me wake up
There's your hand
So incredible
The love we have, the things we hold

You pull me through when I get stuck

You'll never let me go

They've been there, watched me grow
And put me to the test
I've been told so many times
Be careful you might fall
I'm ready for it all
What would you say
If we could make something amazing
Is it too far to where you are
Look at me changing
One frame out of time
I'm crossing the line
To something amazing
I thought the world was small
I thought I'd seen it all
But now it turned around
It's all upside down
I throw these shoes away
And get a brand-<wbr>new pair
To take us out of here
Look how they make me shine
Just like Queen Valentine
This is a special day
What would you say

Can't find the reason, hiding away
Why did it take so long
Empty excuses, scared of what truth is
Kept me from moving on

They‚Äôre suspicious of the fast track crazy girl
Never thought she‚Äôd go there, guess no one really knows her
But she was ready for her new day danger zone
Where there were no safeties, no expectations known
She built a rocket ship, fueled up a mind made sky
Stardust on her boots, a laser gun that shoots
Packed up her saddle bag, looked up and said goodbye
As she fired up her brushed steel rocket ride
She looked into his moonlit baby blues
Held out her hand and said, tonight you gotta choose
And she said
Space cowboy, come and ride with me
Space cowboy, ride my galaxy
Into the great unknown, the endless skies
Jupiter has got me hypnotized, I said
Space cowboy, come and ride with me
Now we‚Äôll be chasing all the steel horse rodeos
Find our new horizon, beyond the fallen skies and
We‚Äôll set fire to a sun storm power show
And we‚Äôll live forever and in the dark we‚Äôll glow
And you will be my sidekick with the silver spurs
Our power will electrify the universe
And she said
Space cowboy, come and ride with me
Space cowboy, ride my galaxy
Into the great unknown, the endless skies
Jupiter has got me hypnotized, I said
Space cowboy, come and ride with me
Into the great unknown, the endless skies
Jupiter has got me hypnotized

Slowly bloomed then quickly passed away
The butterflies have long gone still
I saved them all and put them on display
Love me, never let me go

You come and go just like the wind
Whispering, and I give in

Let me get lost in
My only memory is you
I would give all I have
I'll hold my hand out
Hoping that you'll find
And if you do
On my way to catch a train
On an early morning, pouring rainy grey
I saw a man come round the bend
The way he stopped
And turned his head to say
I heard him say
Stay with me

The Angels Rejoiced Last Night
A house not a home was a picture satan painted
For sweet little sister and me
Our daddy would frown while mother was praying
His heart was so hardened that he would not believe
His Sundays were spent out with the gamblin' crowd
I've never seen my daddy inside a house of God
For Satin held his hand down the path of sin he trod
Not long ago our circle was broken
When God called on mother one night
In a voice sweet and low her last words were spoken
Asking our daddy to raise her children right
The angels rejoiced in heaven last night
I heard my daddy praying dear God make it right
He was smiling and singing with tears in his eyes
While mother with the angels rejoiced last night
While mother with the angels rejoiced last night

Captures me again
The words it threw my way
Filled my soul with pain
My anger into space
Almost found its way again
Questions to embrace
Feelings that you‚Äôll face
In this holy land
A desert made of quicksand
Streets that lead you there
Places of your fear
Some force, pulls you in
The shadow world 
About the time I made the great escape
I was falling, falling, falling from heaven
In every picture that I drew, I saw you 
Falling, falling, falling from heaven
From an empty face
The smile wiped away
Eyes that never see
Blind the deepest me
Act a small charade
Words you can‚Äôt explain
Silence louder than the doubt
Lingers in the sound
By the time I made the great escape
I was falling, falling, falling from heaven
In every picture that I drew, I saw you 
Falling, falling, falling from heaven
I got down on my knees and prayed
I was calling, calling, calling to heaven
Just in time I made the great escape
I was falling, falling, falling from heaven
If you just talk to me
If you just look at me
We‚Äôll be all right

Told the sun, not to shine and stay away
I told the lake, to go dry and wash away
Am I wrong, am I strong, walk away
Do I know there are no words to say
Am I yours, Am I mine, anyway
Do I know there are no words
I am the only princess, I'm indestructible
I am winged victory, I am so breakable
I am the distant planet, I am the golden sun
I am the broken pieces, I am the lonely one
Asked the sky, to fall down on you
Asked the night, to be solid proof
Am I good, am I bad, or the same
Am I bad, am I worse, stay away
Is there anything else left to say,
Are there really any words
I am the flying spaceship, Identifiable
I am the perfect lover, tell me I'm loveable
I am the distant planet, I am the purple sun
I am the highest mountain, I am the lonely one
So here's me now, without you
I turn the lights out, without you
Should I be frightened, without you
Always night now without you
I am the darkest morning, I am the sleeping fool
I am the wandering gypsy, I'm right here next to you

Will you give all you got to give, are you making it up a bit
Are you losing your mind, losing track of time
Hide yourself in a masquerade, falling into this escapade
Watch yourself dancing with the clowns
Did you think you would be up with the kings and the queens
Building castles of sand, it gets out of hand
You know there's no guarantee surviving anomalies
No one can breathe in the sea, ironically
No one is running the show, no one is letting you know
That you will end up alone, keep running and running and running and running
Are there places that you hide, that echo your innocence
Run away from the fire, you are burning up inside
Lost control of the truth and the lies, it is lonely where you go
I have been there, so I know the way
Back to the other side
Counteract and get physical, deaf to anything critical
I don't mean to be cynical but you're fading away
Everybody has disappeared, will the walls listen to your fears
There's no reflection here, ironically
No one is running the show, no one is letting you know
That you will end up alone, keep running and running and running and running
Are there places that you hide, that echo your innocence
Run away from the fire, you are burning up inside

Will we always be?
Will we always be?
Now the time has come, I'm overdone
This time I must know, as sure as I can know
And listening to the rumbling of walls
As they come tumbling down, down, down
I may not dare to show you
I might just walk away or crawl under another rock
It's so tempting, as you're attempting, to reel me in again
Break me, so I'm no longer
Build me, so I am stronger
Please still me
Please fill me
Will we always be?
Here I am with the desert sand in my Dead Sea eyes
And I can cry all I want and I can die all I want
I'll even lie if that's what you want me to do
There's no one else to rescue me but you
I'm a lost refugee, old flying gypsy dancer
I got to save myself for me
But I'm gonna save myself for you
I always do
Break me, so I'm no longer
Build me, so I am stronger
Please still me
Please fill me
Will we always be?

They say (demo version)
They say...
When a tree's standing tall
The harder it will fall
It's easy to give in
When catching all the wind
I've heard, I've heard
Those who walk alone
Are finding their own roads
That they wander with resolve
And never lost at all
And take all these little thoughts and
Place them in hidden pockets
Save 'em for a rainy day
And whispers so badly needed
Faith, something to believe in
All those truths from yesterdays
Sometimes...
Even hurry has to rest
And as it's catching breath
Make sure you look around
Know exactly what you have
And take all these little thoughts and
Place them in hidden pockets
Save 'em for a rainy day
And whispers so badly needed
Faith, something to believe in
All those truths from yesterdays
Ohohohoh
Ohohohoh
Ohohohoh!
And take all these little thoughts and
Place them in hidden pockets
Save 'em for a rainy day
And whispers so badly needed
Faith, something to believe in
All those truths from yesterdays
So am I...
A tree that's standing tall?

Time out
Held hands too tight in clench and fight
So what went wrong when everything it seemed so right
Lights turned red, empty bed, questions crawling off the wall into my head
Why you‚Äôre gone
Is it too late to forgive
Are we too far to forget
Is it over or will we regret
Taking time out
Things we say just cut and paste
Over and over again without communicating
Corners bent, edge‚Äôs gone
There‚Äôs nothing left except over exaggerating
Are we gone
Is it too late to forgive
Are we too far to forget
Is it over or will we regret
Is it too late to forgive
Are we too far to forget
Is it over or will we regret
Taking time out
If you walk away will I know who I am
If we stay together it could be the end
Is it too late to forgive
Are we too far to forget
Is it over or will we regret
Is it too late to forgive
Are we too far to forget
Is it over or will we regret
Taking time out
And the thicker skin to keep it in
Please take this load I‚Äôm carrying
Holes that led the truth back in
The black and white is colored in
I don‚Äôt want to be untouchable

Time Will Have To Wait
I hold your hand, I feel your fear
I‚Äôve been so close but never near
But now that we face the unknown
You say it‚Äôs harder for me
I think it‚Äôs harder for you
Now there‚Äôs no more plans to make
It‚Äôs not important, it can wait
Just let me take care of you
You say it‚Äôs harder for me
I think it‚Äôs harder for you
Time will just have to wait
Time will just have to wait
In a heart lies all that matters
It won‚Äôt dry up with this tears
And these moments will run deeper
Than the rushing of the years
Time will just have to wait
This goodbye, is so loud
Couse we don‚Äôt know, when, where or how
Until then I carry us proudly
You say it‚Äôs harder for me
I think it‚Äôs harder for you
Time will just have to wait
Time will just have to wait
In a heart lies all that matters
It won‚Äôt dry up with this tears
And these moments will run deeper
Than the rushing of the years
Don‚Äôt hide the pain in your eyes
Don‚Äôt lose yourself protecting me
Don‚Äôt be afraid of what will be
I know it‚Äôs harder for you
You think it‚Äôs harder for me
Time will just have to wait
Time will just have to wait
Time will just have to wait

Turn Around
All that I wanted to say,
I can't help but feeling this way
I know it can all go away, in a day
A picture of you by my side,
It fades with the tears that I cry
But you'd be afraid in my mind
For old times
And when I held you in my arms,
And the storm in my heart was calm
Now you left me as I was found
There's a nickel old and sound
Please turn around
Please turn around
Just as I started moving on
Counted the hours one by one
But in the steal of the moment I froze
And they put me back where I begun
And when I held you in my arms,
And the storm in my heart was calm
Now you left me as I was found
On the ground
Late at night when I go to sleep
I can feel you right there with me
In the place where we once stood proud
There's a nickel old and sound
Please turn around
Please turn around
Please turn around
Please turn around

Shines so bright that it blinds

Trembling our lives begin
Safety nets have holes that led the truth back in

Current of people
Moving like rolling stones
I try to follow
But they‚Äôre just a sea of ghost
Get lost in a dream
The ground doesn‚Äôt seem so low
Trembling our lives begin
Safety nets have holes that led the truth back in

Untouchable

Was it love
Who throws out the lifelines
Who can swim the deepest ocean
Who can trust the sky won't fall
Who can trust they know it all
All the whispers that I share
All the moments by myself
When I know that you're not here
And I gather all my fears
And they're locked inside believe
But they're not inside of me
And it's fallen from a trust
And it all resolves to dust
Is it possible to see
With every moment over
What the reason was for me
Was it love
Was it love
Is it you who makes the sun rise
Is it you who makes my eyes dry
Was it you who gave it all
Can I trust the sky won't fall
I have loved and I have hated
I have jumped too soon then waited
And every time I've fallen down
And every time I almost drowned
And they're locked inside believe
But they're not inside of me
And it's fallen from a trust
And it all resolves to dust
Is it possible to see
With every moment over
What the reason was for me
Was it love
Was it love
So when I walk into walls
Or run out of control
Or feel I've lost my soul
Or I can't take no more
And when all I know is lost
I'm broken and alone
When I am just a ghost
Who's looking for her home
Like Faith without faith
And they're locked inside believe
But they're not inside of me
And it's fallen from a trust
And it all resolves to dust
Is it possible to see
With every moment over
What the reason was for me
Was it love
Was it love

Watch the water burn
Between a million stars
Must be one for me
Make the fire start
Come fill up my heart
I have tried so hard
To keep control
Make me laugh and cry
Never satisfy
Make me wonder why
Feels like I know where I go
When I'm not
How to let go 
All I know I forgot
Feel like I know where I go
Watch me go
I was running out
In the hourglass
Falling through like sand
Nowhere to land
Candle's burning down
In this shallow ground
There's no mystery
I was missing me
Now I recognize
There's no compromise
Learn to let it fly
Feels like I know where I go
When I'm not
How to let go 
All I know I forgot
Feel like I know where I go
Watch me go
Feels like I know where I go

Inside a waterfall

Beneath the touch of softer skin

And white and blue the empty sky
Painted in my eyes
Black the night will always be
A star
The gift of love it almost shines
Words from hearts, that almost rhyme
Like holding heaven in your hand
Another world, a grain of sand
The earth under my feet
Floating weightless, lifting me
You are what I'll be
You are where I'll be
My fortune's in between the lines
It guides me through all time
So all I do is float with you
Cause you are where I'll be
The gift of love it almost shines
Words from hearts, that almost rhyme
Like holding heaven in your hand
Another world, a grain of sand
The earth under my feet
Floating weightless, lifting me
You are what I'll be
You are where I'll be
Beyond gravity, weightless me
Endlessly
The gift of love it almost shines
Words from hearts, that almost rhyme
Like holding heaven in your hand
Another world, a grain of sand

Floating weightless, lifting me

We're alright
If it's a misconception
Then why do I feel alone
With no direction anywhere, anyways
It's such a crooked circle and I'm running around again
Looking for exit signs and borderlines to take me
Somewhere different, someplace new
Where I can feel alive
I want to start to feel the world again
I want to find a place I've never been
Not gonna wait until they tell me when, we're alright
And if you want to, you can meet me there
We'll be together though we don't know where
And for the first time I am so aware
We're alright
If nothing ever changes, then why is it that I see
So many different faces always looking back at me
Have they always been there, maybe all that's new is me
Facing the opportunities that set me free
Take me somewhere different, someplace new
Where I can feel alive
I want to start to feel the world again
I want to find a place I've never been
Not gonna wait until they tell me when, we're alright
And if you want to, you can meet me there
We'll be together though we don't know where
And for the first time I am so aware
We're alright
I won't look back
I won't go back
There's no turning back this time
I want to start to feel the world again
I want to find a place I've never been
Not gonna wait until they tell me when, we're alright
And if you wan to you can meet me there
We'll be together though we don't know where

What does your heart say now
Yesterday we kept a safer distance
We walked a borderline that seemed so clear
We crossed that line Previous night
It vanished with the morning light
Now I wanna know, where do we go from here
chorus:
What does your heart say now
Now that we have touched, now that we have kissed
What does your heart say now
Now that its come to this
Is it the same, or has something changed
Now that we have let our guards down
I just want to know, what does your heart say now
Previous night we said things one soul to another
In ways that spoken words could not express
No room was left for doubt
But I dont know where I stand now
Dont leave me in the dark
Dont make me guess

When
Before me there's nothing
An empty space, an empty heart
Reaching for forever
Without a place to start
Before me there's this angel
Who's too afraid to cry
Her wings they have been broken
Help me teach her how to fly
Before me there's an ocean
I'm familiar with his color with it's blue
It's beyond my every notion
I know its depht is true
Before me there's a mountain
I have to climb to see
But I know there will be waiting
A better view of you and me
When I've swam across the ocean
When I've climbed the mountain top
When I've seen the angel flying
Then I can die to heal your heart
Above me there's an endless sky
But the clouds are never still
In every way like you
Do we love the thing we kill
Can we fight the doubts we keep alive
Can we overcome all fear
Is the battle ever over
Is it ever really over
When I don't try to stop the sky
When I let the clouds be free
When nothing scares me anymore
When I killed the down in me
When I've swam across the ocean
When I've climbed the mountain top
When I've seen the angel flying
Then I can die to heal your heart
Before me there was nothing
Empty space, an empty heart
Reaching for forever
Without a place to start
Before me there's this angel
Who was too afraid to cry
And her wings they had been broken
And now I watch her fly

He knows your name, but it's not the same, without you
And every morning
One cup of coffee, not two
I start to cry, but I always try, not to
Cause I know, you see me when I long for you
Now there's just one left of us, not two
I can hear you talking
I can feel you still
Alone now I am walking
Can't see past the hill
A part of me says I should be with you
A part of me, has learned to be, without you
I still wear the ring
It's one of those things from you
And your old radio
Plays songs that I know from you
We danced until we felt the morning dew
And I'm thinking of, how I learned love, from you
I can hear you talking

The silence that's fallen between us,

how can we find forgiveness,
if we can't find the words.
Chores:
When we don't talk,
when we don't speak,
when we don't share all the feelings,
that are buried so deep,
how can we know,
what's hidden behind these walls?
when the door's locked.
When we lose touch
when you and i lose sight of us
the honesty's lost
and the tears say it all
we don't talk
So much goes unspoken
and sorry is left unsaid
the silence remains unbroken
and our hearts are breaking instead
Chores

Knocking at my door again
We both know you're gonna win
When I'm in those arms of yours
I can't turn my back
When you put it like that
Put it like that
Right here in front of me is all I'll ever need
And when you touch me like that
Hold me like that
Love me like that
Forever sure sounds good
When you put it like that
So much for being strong
My mind's set but my heart too gone, safe me
I'd like to think I gotta choice
And deep down that little voice don't phase me
When I see you standing here
Everything is crystal clear
And all my doubts just disappear
When you're holdin' me like this

Winter of love
You're disconnected somehow,
Live on different sides now
Divided by the seasons weak
Created from discarded dreams
You let the fire burn out
Into the ashes of doubt
The night grows longer day by day
The north wind is on its way!
This winter of love is falling on us
Leaving our hearts in the cold and the darkness
Lost in a frozen dance
Is there still life berried under the suns?
Is there an... of us left in the black sun?
This winter of love!
Will the sun ever come (come to rescue us?)
Put us back into one (put us back into one)
Clouds give way to skies of blue
Will we make it through?
This winter of love is falling on us
Leaving our hearts in the cold and the darkness
Lost in a frozen dance
Is there still life berried under the suns?

Day one God smiled,
Gave us all the wisdom of a newborn child
But by the time we take our first step
We've already begun to forget 
What the heart knows the heart sees
We're just as much the forest, as we are the trees
Every little seed trying to find Where the light comes from
Chorus:
And it's a world of hurt, nothing works
It's a lonely little planet made of dust and dirt
Who'd ever think that in the midst of all this
Something as beautiful as love exists
And when I hold you, and you hold me
Heaven doesn't seem like such a mystery
Darling in a world of hurt
You make me feel so good
Day one of our love,
Two heartbroken people scared to trust too much
Oh but here it comes that feelin' again 
That every lover swears will never end 
We thought we'd been there, done that, 
But when we kissed 
We knew we'd never been here..
We've never done this 
All the walls come tumblin' down
When you love someone

Just step into our world with me

Lyrics
I lived my life, convinced i find your love somehow, somewhere.
I healt on to the faith that you would show yourself one day.
Something in me believed, this night was meant to be.
(CHORUS)
You are the promise
I made to my heart
You are the vision
I saw in the dark
You are the reason
I waited so patiently
So many nights when I closed my eyes
It's you that I have seen
I am the dreamer
You are the dream.
It wasn't always clear to see
where I was headed to
But of all lifes roads
Somehow I choose the one that led to you
Doesn't matter how far I've been

----------------------------------------
When your troubled heart is restless
And your morning's feeling blue
And a part of you is doubting everything you ever knew
When you're running fast from darkness
And it's just a step behind
And your feet they start to stumble on the shadows in your mind
Just hold on to the knowing
That it's gonna be allright
And the arms of salvation will be holding you tonight
(yes they will)
In the quiet of the healing
In the falling of the light
There's a simple sort of certainty when love is at your side
So when that hard rain starts to sting you
And that cold wind starts to bite
You know there's freedom in surrender
Baby you don't have to fight
Just hold on to the knowing
That it's gonna be allright
And the arms of salvation will be holding you tonight
Just hold on to the knowing
That it's gonna be allright
And the arms of salvation will be holding you tonight
(yes they will)
Arms of salvation

Calm after the storm
Driving in a fast lane
Counting boundary marker signs
The empty seat beside me
Keeps you on my mind
Living in a heartache
There is something I pursue
I can keep on chasing
What I can be for you
Oooo skies are black and blue
Thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm
Tears on a highway
Water in my eyes
This rain ain't gonna change us
So I used to cry
I can say I'm sorry
But I don't wanna lie
I just wanna know if staying
Is better than goodbye
Oooo skies are black and blue
Thinking about you
Here in the calm after the story
Oooo after all that we've been through
There ain't nothin' new
Here in the calm after the storm
Baby I can find you
Down this broken line
Maybe you can find me
I guess we'll know in time
Oooo skies are black and blue
Thinking about you
Here in the calm after the storm
There ain't nothing new
Here in the calm after the storm

Give me a reason
This second single from the common linnets, is special because they released this "Radio edit",
but this is not an edit off the album version, in fact the song plays just as long the album version.
But what they did was remove Waylon parts from the recording, by mixing the song again.
This because after the break-<wbr>up with Waylon

Hearts on fire
So there you are, alone and proud
Another wasted evening down
Telling yourself is what you need
Till you're back on your feet
I know those winds that changed your course
And never blown so hard before
But that was then and this is now
Baby, come on out
Did you feel your heart's on fire
Did you see the sparks are flying
Burn in the night, yeah, we
Are the wild and free
Did you feel your heart's on fire
Hearts on fire
No clock is counting down the time
No walls between your heart and mine
It's all been set in motion
In motion, no explosion
These city's streets are yours to roam
This glass and steel and stones, your own
It's all here waiting for you
I'm right here waiting
Did you feel your heart's on fire
Did you see the sparks are flying
Burn in the night, yeah, we
Are the wild and free
Did you feel your heart's on fire
Did you feel your heart's on fire
Did you see the sparks are flying
Burn in the night, yeah, we
Are the wild and free
Did you feel your heart's on fire
Hearts on fire
Hearts on fire
I've been waiting (Been waiting)
I've been waiting
Burn in the night, yeah, we
Are the wild and free
Did you feel your heart's on fire
Did you feel your heart's on fire
Did you see the sparks are flying
Burn in the night, yeah, we
Are the wild and free
Did you feel your heart's on fire
Hearts on fire

Love goes on, lyrics
Please don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôve forgotten
who you were and are to me
there‚Äôs a safe place in my heart
there you‚Äôll always be with me
years pass by and we get older
there‚Äôs so much you didn‚Äôt see
but your hand is still on my shoulder
much more than a memory
endless highway, bring me home
all I know is that our love goes on
You‚Äôre in me and in my brothers
Yes and mom still wears your ring
For her, there‚Äôll never be another
You don‚Äôt compare to anything
Singing songs while doing dishes
Cracking jokes, you filled the room
I miss your laughter and your kisses
That‚Äôs how I‚Äôll remember you
Endless highway, bring me home
All I know is that our love goes on
Yes, all I know is, that our love goes on

Runaway man
When i was younger, and all i had to do
Was hold your hand and drink you in and make some time for you
I went stumbling through the darkness of a thousand half-<wbr>lit bars
I don‚Äôt know what i was running from, but I must have run too far
Now I‚Äôm reaching back for something
But I‚Äôm coming up with nothing
And it‚Äôs a long long way from where i was to where i am
God have mercy on a runaway man
God have mercy on a runaway man
The key under your doormat, the porch light you left lit
The years dragged on and burred away just like a cigarette
And the price of all those nights was never worth the morning cost
No, no amount of wishing‚Äôs gonna bring back what I lost
And now i‚Äôm reaching back for something
But i‚Äôm coming up with nothing
And it‚Äôs a long long way from where i was to where i am
God have mercy on a runaway man
God have mercy on a runaway man
And it‚Äôs a long long way from where i was to where i am
God have mercy on a runaway man
God have mercy on a runaway man
God have mercy on a runaway man
God have mercy on a runaway man

Still loving after you
Half a world away
and a thousand nights behind
I am still loving after you
In the darkness of my days
in the silence of my mind
I am still loving after you
And your beautiful dreams are illusions
and the song that you sing is not true
But for all the tears I‚Äôve cried
and the times that you have lied
I am still loving after you
I'm a stranger to these streets
A ghost behind these walls
And regrets I've more than a few
With a heart that's hurting hollow.
Broken by a fall
I am still loving after you
And your beautiful dreams are illusions
and the song that you sing is not true
But for all the tears I‚Äôve cried
and the times that you have lied
I am still loving after you.
I thought one day I might be in love
deserving of your love 
I quess I must not know when to give up
because I'm not giving up
And your beautiful dreams are illusions
and the song that you sing is not true
But for all the tears I‚Äôve cried
and the times that you have lied
I am still loving after you
But for all the tears I‚Äôve cried
and the times that you have lied
I am still loving after you
Cause I am still loving after you‚Ä¶

----------------------------------------
Where do i go with me
I could give it up and leave you any given moment in time
If I should walk away this evening, see if I can get you off my mind
If I should break my promises and answer to a feeling just to see
It would leave me with one question, Lord
Where do I go with me
I will follow all the little signs and whispers from your dark and tender touch
I will drink the water from your well
But I guess that it could drown me just as much
and you could be a memory and I could dream of all that I could be
But It ain't hard to figure out my love
Where do I go with me
Where do I go with me
Is there a place for me to fall apart
You got me down on my knees
Where do I go with me
Where do I go with me
Is there a place for me to fall apart
You got my down on my knees
Where do I go with me
You got my down on my knees
Where do I go with me
